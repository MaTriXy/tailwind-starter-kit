# Tailwind CSS Accordion

David UI's accordion component is built with Tailwind CSS and HTML to create sleek expand/collapse sections. Perfect for FAQs, menus, and content toggling, it provides an interactive way to organize information. 

Customize styles effortlessly and explore examples to integrate this versatile, responsive component into your design.


---

## Basic Accordion

Create an SEO-optimized accordion component with exclusive mode using `data-dui-accordion-mode="exclusive"`. This ensures only one section stays open at a time, ideal for FAQ pages and content organization. The semantic HTML and ARIA attributes enhance both accessibility and search engine visibility while providing an excellent user experience.

## Accordion All Open

Enhance content accessibility and SEO with the "all-open" accordion mode. Using `data-dui-accordion-mode="all-open"` allows users to view multiple sections simultaneously while maintaining collapse functionality. This feature optimizes content visibility and user engagement by displaying information upfront. Ideal for documentation and content-rich pages, the semantic HTML and ARIA attributes ensure proper accessibility and search engine indexing.

## Controlled Accordion

The Accordion component can operate in both controlled and uncontrolled modes. In controlled mode, you have full control over its state using the `value` and `onValueChange` properties.

---

## Accordion Custom Icon

Customize the accordion's toggle icons using `data-dui-accordion-icon-close` and `data-dui-accordion-icon-open` attributes. These allow you to seamlessly switch between different icons based on the accordion's open/closed state, enhancing visual feedback and user experience.

## Accordion Custom Styles

Tailor the appearance of your Accordion by applying styles through the `className` property. The example demonstrates how to design a unique look for the Accordion component.

---

## Accordion Disabled

Enhance accessibility and user experience by disabling specific accordion sections using `aria-disabled="true"`. This attribute prevents user interaction and clearly indicates non-interactive content, improving both SEO and usability. Disabled sections maintain visual consistency while being properly marked up for screen readers and search engines.

## Required Script

The Accordion component in david-ai requires JavaScript to handle the accordion functionality. The library provides smooth transitions and collapse/expand behavior through data attributes.

### Installation

To use the Accordion component in your project, you first need to install the `david-ai` library via npm:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={`npm install david-ai`}/>

### Basic Usage

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`import { initAccordion } from 'david-ai';

// Initialize accordion functionality
initAccordion();
`
}/>

### Using with Global Access
If you prefer, you can use the DavidAI global object instead of directly importing initAccordion:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`import * as DavidAI from 'david-ai';

// Initialize accordion functionality
DavidAI.initAccordion();
`
}/>

### Using with CDN
You can include david-ai via a CDN and initialize accordion functionality globally in the browser. Add the following script to your HTML file:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/creativetimofficial/david-ai@1.0.4/packages/dist/david-ai.min.js" defer></script>`}/>

### HTML Code Example

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`<div class="group block w-full" aria-disabled="false" data-dui-accordion-container data-dui-accordion-mode="exclusive">
    <div 
      class="flex items-center justify-between w-full py-5 text-left font-medium dark:text-white text-stone-800 cursor-pointer"
