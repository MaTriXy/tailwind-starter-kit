# Tailwind CSS Pagination

Navigate large datasets or multi-page layouts easily with David UIâ€™s pagination component. Tailwind CSS makes it fully customizable and responsive. 

The navigation component provides navigation controls (e.g., previous, next, or numbered page links) that allow users to browse through the data one page at a time, rather than loading all the content at once.

Explore examples to integrate intuitive pagination into your application seamlessly.
