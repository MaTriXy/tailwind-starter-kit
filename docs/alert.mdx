## Required Script

The Alert component in david-ai is only dependent on JavaScript if you are using dismissible alerts. This means if your alert includes a dismiss button with `data-dui-dismiss="alert"`, the library's JavaScript is required to enable the functionality for closing the alert. 

### Installation

To use the Alert component in your project, you first need to install the `david-ai` library via npm:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={`npm install david-ai`}/>


### Basic Usage

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`import { initAlert } from 'david-ai';

// Initialize alerts
initAlert();
`
}/>

### Using with Global Access
If you prefer, you can use the DavidAI global object instead of directly importing initAlert:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`import * as DavidAI from 'david-ai';

// Initialize alerts 
DavidAI.initAlert();
`
}/>

### Using with CDN
You can include david-ai via a CDN and initialize alerts globally in the browser. Add the following script to your HTML file:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/creativetimofficial/david-ai@1.0.6/packages/dist/david-ai.min.js" defer></script>`}/>

### HTML Code Example

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`<div role="alert" class="relative flex items-start w-full border rounded-md p-2 bg-stone-800 border-stone-800 text-stone-50">
    <div class="w-full text-sm font-sans leading-none m-1.5">A simple alert for showing message</div>
    <button data-dui-dismiss="alert" class="outline-none">x</button>
</div>
`
}/>
