## Image with Rounded Corners

## Circular Image

Use `rounded-full` class to round the corners of the image into a circle. This effect will be most noticeable if the image is square; otherwise, the image will look elliptical.

## Image with Shadow

Enhance your image with a depth-adding shadow by applying the `shadow-xl` and `shadow-black/25` classes. This subtle black shadow with reduced opacity helps the image stand out against its background.

## Image with Blurred Caption

Apply a semi-transparent white background with a blur effect (backdrop-blur-md) to the caption for improved readability over the image. Additional border, padding, and shadow elements elevate the overall design and clarity.
