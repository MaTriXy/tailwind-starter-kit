## Basic Gallery

This example provides a clean and responsive image gallery arranged in a grid. It adapts seamlessly from a single column on small screens to multiple columns on larger screens. The images maintain a uniform size using the object-cover class, ensuring consistent proportions and a polished appearance.

## Required Script

The Gallery component in david-ai requires JavaScript to handle image switching and thumbnail interactions. The library provides smooth transitions and interactive behavior through data attributes.

### Installation

To use the Gallery component in your project, you first need to install the `david-ai` library via npm:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={`npm install david-ai`}/>

### Basic Usage

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`import { initGallery } from 'david-ai';

// Initialize gallery functionality
initGallery();
`
}/>

### Using with Global Access
If you prefer, you can use the DavidAI global object instead of directly importing initGallery:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`import * as DavidAI from 'david-ai';

// Initialize gallery functionality
DavidAI.initGallery();
`
}/>

### Using with CDN
You can include david-ai via a CDN and initialize gallery functionality globally in the browser. Add the following script to your HTML file:

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={`<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/creativetimofficial/david-ai@1.0.6/packages/dist/david-ai.min.js" defer></script>`}/>

### HTML Code Example

<CodePreviewTailwindClasses codeSnippet={
`<div class="grid gap-4">
    <div>
      <img data-main-image class="h-auto w-full max-w-full rounded-lg object-cover object-center md:h-[480px]" src="path/to/main/image.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>
    <div class="grid grid-cols-5 gap-4">
      <div>
        <img data-thumbnail src="path/to/thumbnail1.jpg" class="object-cover object-center h-20 max-w-full rounded-lg cursor-pointer" alt="gallery-image" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <img data-thumbnail src="path/to/thumbnail2.jpg" class="object-cover object-center h-20 max-w-full rounded-lg cursor-pointer" alt="gallery-image" />
      </div>
    </div>
</div>`
}/>

### Gallery with tab

The gallery with tabs component requires the same JavaScript from the Tabs component to function properly. Please refer to the [Tabs Component](david-ui/docs/html/tabs#required-script) documentation for the required initialization code.
